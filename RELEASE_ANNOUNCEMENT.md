# PUBPAY: Major Update Release

What if Lightning payments felt as natural as posting on Nostr? What if you could turn any event into a beautiful, interactive experience?

After months of development, we're excited to share a complete rewrite of PUBPAY. This update transforms how you request payments, pay for services, run live events, or engage with an audience.

## TL;DR

- **PUBPAY**: Fundraising, multiple payment methods, enhanced QR scanner, mnemonic recovery, and much more
- **PUBPAY LIVE**: Customization system with presets, zap from any Lightning wallet, fiat currency conversions, and much more
- **PUBPAY Multi LIVE** (NEW): Running a LIVE event? Multi Live makes it effortless. Set it up once, and let it run.

## The Journey

PUBPAY was born during a Sovereign Engineering cohort, a 6-week intensive program in Madeira where builders collaborate on Bitcoin and Nostr applications. We've had a deep interest in Lightning payments and experience from building Chain Duel—a competitive Lightning video game we've been displaying at Bitcoin conferences around the world for nearly 3 years. With support from some of Nostr's best minds, we built the foundation for what PUBPAY would become.

PUBPAY LIVE came to life through a partnership with Plan B Network and Roger9000 for his performance at the Adopting Bitcoin after party. That night showed us something: when payments become part of the performance, something magical happens.

Since then, we've powered LIVE displays at Bitcoin 2025, BCC8333, and other smaller events. The reception from artists, event organizers, and audiences has been incredible. That energy—seeing people engage with Lightning payments in real-time, watching performers connect with their audience, hearing event organizers say "this is exactly what we needed"—that's what motivated us to make PUBPAY better than ever.

This release is the result of that journey. Built with real feedback, tested at real events, refined through real use.

## PUBPAY: Send and receive Lightning payments as easily as posting on social media.

Think of PUBPAY as Venmo meets Twitter. PUBPAY lets you create payment requests (we call them "paynotes") and share them like any social media post. Whether you're fundraising, splitting bills, selling products, or requesting payments for services—get paid instantly. No complicated forms, no merchant accounts, just fast, social payments.

### Key Features

- **Flexible Payment Rules**: Create payment requests that fit your exact needs. Set amounts, goals, and limits.
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Pay with a Lightning Wallet, WebLN, or Nostr Wallet Connect. You can even zap anonymously.
- **Flexible Login Options**: Choose what works for you. Sign in with extension (nip-07), signer (nip-46), or private key (nsec). 
- **Secure Key Storage**: Your nsec is encrypted with AES-GCM using either your device key (automatic) or a password (optional).
- **Anonymous Payments**: Pay without logging in. For privacy-conscious users.
- **Mnemonic Recovery**: Recover your account anytime with just your words.
- **QR Code Scanner**: Scan any notes, profiles, or events to navigate instantly. Even scan your nsec to log in.

## PUBPAY LIVE: Turn any Nostr note into a stunning payable display.

That's PUBPAY—Lightning payments made social. But imagine this: You're on stage, performing. A QR code appears on the screen behind you. Someone in the audience scans it and zaps you 100,000 sats. The screen explodes with an animation—their name, their avatar, spinning letters spelling "TOP ZAP." The audience sees it. More zaps come in. More animations. The energy builds. PUBPAY LIVE payments into a performance.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Notifications**: Animated notifications appear when new payments come in
- **Lightning Payments for Everyone**: No account needed—anyone with Lightning can pay. Shows received amounts in USD, EUR, and more
- **Stage-Ready Display**: Clean, distraction-free interface that works perfectly on stage screens and projectors
- **Complete Visual Control**: Quick presets, full customization, many layout options, QR code blend modes, shareable styles, and more

## Multi Live: Schedule-driven live displays for meetups, festivals, and conferences.

PUBPAY LIVE is perfect for one display, one event, one moment. But what if you're managing multiple stages? What if you need different displays for different performers or speakers, rotating seamlessly? What if you want to rehearse your entire event before going live? Multi Live lets you program everything beforehand. Use the intuitive timeline interface to schedule which paynote displays when, set rotation intervals, and watch it run. No more manual switching. No more missed transitions.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Timeline**: Visual editor for scheduling. See slots, conflicts, and all details instantly.
- **Simulation Mode**: Rehearse your entire event. Play, pause, speed up, and jump between slots.
- **Automatic Rotation**: Multiple items per slot rotate automatically at precise schedule times.
- **Real-time Sync**: Keep all screens in sync instantly. No manual refresh needed.
- **Secure & Safe**: Separate admin and viewer links. Password-protected admin access.

## What It All Adds Up To

PUBPAY starts with a simple idea: payments should be easy. Create a paynote, share it, get paid. But it doesn't stop there.

PUBPAY LIVE takes those payments and makes them visible, interactive, and engaging. It makes payments part of the experience.

Multi Live scales it all. Program multiple displays, schedule content, and let it run automatically. From single displays to multi-room events—PUBPAY grows with you. All built on Nostr, all permissionless, all yours.
